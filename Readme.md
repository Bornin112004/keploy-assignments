## 🗄️ Database

- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Models:**  
  - `Student` (id, name, email)  
  - `Assignment` (id, title, description, due_date)  
  - `Submission` (id, student_id, assignment_id, submitted_at)

**Integration:**  
SQLAlchemy ORM is used for all database operations.  
The connection string is set in `app/database.py`:
```python
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+psycopg2://<user>:<password>@localhost/assignments_db"
```
